        #Since each node in the tree is visited / added to the queue only once, the time complexity is O(n), where nn is the number of nodes in the tree.

#Space complexity is O(n), since in the worst case, the queue will contain all nodes in one level of the binary tree. For a full binary tree, the leaf level has n/2 = 0(n) leaves.

        #recursionBecause of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
